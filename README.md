**Introduction**

The LinkedIn Connection Analyzer and Visa Recommendation script is designed to help users gain insights into their LinkedIn connections and provide recommendations for enhancing their professional network. The script utilizes sentiment analysis techniques to cluster and define the companies where their LinkedIn connections work. It also leverages a large, locally downloaded but publicly available dataset to determine visa recommendations based on the likelihood of obtaining a visa.

**Installation**

To use this script, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://github.com/[username]/[repository-name].git
```
2. Install the required dependencies by running the following command:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**Usage**

To use the script, you will first need the data from your personal linkedIn. Don't worry, none of this information is leaving your own computer. 
Go to your LinkedIn profile, under "Account" you should see "Settings & Privacy". Once you click that, find "Data privacy" on the left panel... then select "Get a copy of your data"... **make sure you select ONLY the Connections** under the 2nd "Want something in particular?" option.
